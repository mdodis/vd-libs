                    <p>
                        Dear reader,

                        <br> <br>

                        In the modern day, programming has become complex. Too complex for what most of the applications
                        can actually do.

                        <br> <br>

                        One common theme that one will see mentioned in various topics, like building a rendering engine
                        , or even something as simple as a static website, is The Stack&trade;: A collection of
                        libraries and frameworks for building solutions to problems <i>the right way</i>.

                        <br> <br>

                        This is most commonly sourced from an aggregate of opinions, an admiration of complexity, even
                        sheer ego, but it rarely comes from the complexity or expansiveness of the problem itself.

                        <br> <br>

                        And partially, it's to be expected; not just because software is affected by business decisions,
                        timelines, and all the various aspects of every-day life - but because it's easy to admire a
                        body of work that appears enormous. We are fascinated and astonished by big buildings and huge
                        imposing sculptures, because that's a signal of dedication and craftsmanship; to some even
                        divine intervention.

                        <br> <br>

                        The reality though, at least for software, is that in most situations, complicated doesn't mean
                        good. For that matter, small & short doesn't mean good either. And as of late, it has become
                        increasingly hard for developers to understand the cost of sourcing external work.

                        <br> <br>

                        Let me be clear; I don't mean that everyone should go back to C, or program in Assembly,
                        and I don't expect anyone to do so, because this pattern of library overuse
                        is present in every programming field. The only reason that there aren't that many instances of
                        C/C++ programmers doing it (mainly C now...) is that it's harder to source external libraries
                        than to actually write them yourself.

                        <br> <br>

                        I encourage anyone who reads this to take a look at any modern project of say, a calculator,
                        and try to tell me if it doesn't look a <b>tad</b> too complicated. Because in most cases, you
                        will see:

                        <ul>
                            <li>Some kind of package manager manifest</li>
                            <li>A UI library (depending on the language context)</li>
                            <li>Some kind of math library</li>
                            <li>And right after the important ones, a ton of other small libraries that do random things
                            </li>
                            <li>Not to mention, that each package has dependencies, which all get resolved into at least
                                a medium size codebase</li>
                        </ul>

                        People will argue that these complexities are required because they solve various problems in
                        the best way possible, and are portable and cross-platform (or cross-browser), so this is just
                        the price you have to pay nowadays.

                        <br> <br>

                        I don't necesarily disagree with this take. I will <b>just</b> point out, that usually, for most
                        of the dependencies these projects bring in into the codebase, they only use a small fraction of
                        the functionalities they provide.

                        <br> <br>

                        And if you, dear reader, think that because you program in C/C++, you are exempted from this,
                        please consider that there are a ton of projects out there that bring in a huge dependency, like
                        SDL (I've got nothing against SDL, just an example), and then use C++ threads, spdlog, printf,
                        <code>std::cout</code>, instead of the portable cross-platform functions that SDL already
                        provides.

                        <br> <br>

                        I won't say that those projects are necessarily doing something wrong; if it works, it works.
                        But I will say that there are hidden or unnoticeable costs to bringing in any dependency into
                        a project.

                        <br> <br>

                        And here we come back to the first point of this section. Why do people use SDL, and what do
                        they use it for?

                        <br> <br>

                        I'll wager that most people use it because that's what they've been told to do, or because
                        someone told them the Win32 API is too complicated, or even convinced them that it'll be better
                        to bring it in early, because then their application will be cross-platform without much work.

                        <br> <br>

                        (Note that I'm using Win32 API as an example here, but this is the same for any platform.)

                        <br> <br>

                        It's not. Really. It's not that complicated, and you can make a wrapper for it in 5 days at
                        most, that will get you 99% of the way there and cover what all of these libraries do for the
                        common case. And you will not have to learn another API to use this one, or look out for
                        updates, or have to fiddle with those libraries' deprecations and introcacies.

                        <br> <br>

                        And this is the purpose of the libraries in here. As I'm writing my engines and doing other
                        experiments, I found it best to wrap some functionality I actually want into libraries that
                        provide solutions to specific problems, and not general ones.

                        <br> <br>

                        I encourage everyone to read the code themselves, not because it's the best or the most bug
                        free, but because I want you, dear reader, to see how simple things can be, even for
                        someone who's not a massive genius or expert in the field.

                        Hi, I'm Michael Dodis.<br>
                        A software engineer from Greece, and I love working on low-level stuff,
                        graphics especially.
                    </p>
